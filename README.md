# ABC_Machine-with-JavaFx-for-students
Application to order student word inputs in alphabetical order using JavaFx. A few of my after school students were given weekly word riddles in which they had to find word answers with certain values. Each letter within the English alphabet were assigned a numeric value based on their position within the alphabet. I created this application to help students organize their words in alphabetical order and in order of word value based on the weekly riddles.
